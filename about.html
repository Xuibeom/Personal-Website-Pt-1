        <p>
          Perhaps my very first hobby, I have always been an avid player of
          video games since about the time I began to walk. During my childhood,
          I played a mix of both PC and various consoles throughout this time;
          however, I only play on my PC nowadays. I enjoy a wide variety of
          games, but my usual go-to is cooperative shooters. Personally, I
          believe my interest in games is one of the major reasons in my
          continued fascination of tech both new and old.

          My second long-withstanding hobby is my interest in militaria, which
          is the interest in the collection and history of military equipment
          around the world. I have been a collector for probably a little over a
          decade, accumulating many things such as helmets, medals, uniforms,
          curios, knives, bayonets, and various surplus firearms that appear on
          the civilian market. Be it flea markets, military surplus stores, gun
          shows, or online outlets I always enjoy the hunt to find something new
          to add to my collection.
