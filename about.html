          <p>
            Perhaps my very first hobby, I have always been an avid player of
            video games since about the time I began to walk. During my
            childhood, I played a mix of both PC and various consoles throughout
            this time; however, I only play on my PC nowadays. I enjoy a wide
            variety of games, but my usual go-to is cooperative shooters.
            Personally, I believe my interest in games is one of the major
            reasons in my continued fascination of tech both new and old.

            My second long-withstanding hobby is my interest in militaria, which
            is the interest in the collection and history of military equipment
            around the world. I have been a collector for probably a little over
            a decade, accumulating many things such as helmets, medals,
            uniforms, curios, knives, bayonets, and various surplus firearms
            that appear on the civilian market. Be it flea markets, military
            surplus stores, gun shows, or online outlets I always enjoy the hunt
            to find something new to add to my collection.
